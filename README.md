# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
This project is an **Airbnb Clone** built as part of the ALX Software Engineering program (Backend Track).  
The goal is to simulate the development of a robust booking platform by focusing on backend architecture, database design, API development, and essential application security principles.

By the end of this project, the system will allow:
- Users to create accounts, browse properties, book stays, leave reviews, and make secure payments.
- Landlords (property owners) to list and manage their properties.
- A scalable backend to handle user interactions efficiently.

## Team Roles
This is an **individual project**, but the following roles represent responsibilities within a typical development team:

- **Backend Developer (Me)**  
  Designs and implements APIs, manages server-side logic, and ensures smooth communication between the client and database.

- **Database Administrator (Me)**  
  Designs and maintains the database schema, relationships, and optimizes queries for performance.

- **API Security Engineer (Me)**  
  Implements authentication, authorization, encryption, and rate limiting to protect the platform from unauthorized access.

- **DevOps/CI-CD Engineer (Future integration)**  
  Responsible for automating builds, tests, and deployments using tools such as Docker and GitHub Actions.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A Python web framework for building the backend and RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing users, properties, bookings, and reviews.  
- **Docker (Future)**: For containerization and environment consistency during deployment.  
- **GitHub Actions (Future)**: For automating testing, integration, and deployment processes.

## Database Design

Key entities and their fields include:

- **Users**
  - `id`
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `password`
  - `role` (tenant/owner)

- **Properties**
  - `id`
  - `owner_id`
  - `title`
  - `location`
  - `price_per_night`

- **Bookings**
  - `id`
  - `user_id`
  - `property_id`
  - `start_date`
  - `end_date`
  - `status`

- **Reviews**
  - `id`
  - `user_id`
  - `property_id`
  - `rating`
  - `comment`

- **Payments**
  - `id`
  - `booking_id`
  - `amount`
  - `payment_status`

### Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to a **User** and a **Property**.  
- A **Review** is linked to both a **User** and a **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is tied to a single **Booking**.  

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Registration, login, and profile management for tenants and property owners.

- **Property Management**  
  Property owners can add, edit, or remove listings with descriptions and pricing.

- **Booking System**  
  Tenants can search for properties, view availability, and make bookings.

- **Review System**  
  Tenants can rate and review properties after their stay.

- **Payment Processing**  
  Securely process booking payments and maintain payment history.

---

## API Security

Security measures to be implemented include:

- **Authentication**: Secure login using Django authentication and potentially JWT tokens.  
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (tenants vs property owners).  
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse by limiting excessive requests.  
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS and hashed passwords to secure sensitive information.  

These measures protect user data, prevent unauthorized bookings, and ensure safe payment processing.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (Conceptual)

Future plans include implementing a CI/CD pipeline to:
- Automate code testing and integration using **GitHub Actions**.
- Containerize the application using **Docker** for seamless deployment.
- Deploy to a staging or production server with minimal downtime.
